# Welcome to Dayton Coffee House!

Dayton Coffee House is the course project for CS 3800 at Wright State University. Dayton Coffee House is an e-commerce website that allows customers to go online and select items they would like to purchase based on what is available in inventory.

## About

Dayton Coffee House uses several development skills such as HTML, CSS and PHP to ensure that users have a fun and easy experience. A provided client would communicate what requirements and concerns they had along the way while the development team ensured quick and efficient solutions. The website is still under maintenance but is working to enhance the site's UX and provide an even better front-end experience!
